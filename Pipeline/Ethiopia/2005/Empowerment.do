Kabeer(1999) warns that deicision making items must capture consequential choices (strategic life choices) rather than
routine/ assigned tasks and that attitudes can rflect deep norms DOXAs

##Attitudes towards wife beating ###
- Signals rejection of "power over" and aligns with Kabeer's notion of agency as the 
power to act versus internalised subordination. - This is a distinct domain. 

###young marriage ###
 - these reflect past life agency contraints not current decision power. Kabeer (1999) cautions that
achieevements can be misread as empowerment without context 

#####Decision Domain ####- 
own health - KEEP 
Large purchases  -KEEP
daily purchases - REMOVE - NOT CONSEQUENTIAL 
visit to family / relatives - KEEP mobility relational autonomy 
contraception - KEEP autonomy 
refuse sex - KEEP bodily autonomy 

for deicisons we will code 1 for women own and both decide as this highlights cooperation ( there might 
be cooercision but we want to be conservative) 0 when husband decided alone 

Weighting:  Kabeer (1999) urges matching indicators to consequential significance - so decision power (A) 0.7 and 
Violence attitudes (B) 0.3 - we can test some of these weights - look into weight testing.
